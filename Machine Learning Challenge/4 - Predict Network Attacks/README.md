## Problem Statement
> Lately, an internet network company in Japan has been facing huge losses due to malicious server attacks. They've encountered breach in data security, reduced data transfer speed and intermittent breakdowns in user-user & user-network connections. When asked, a company official said, " there's a significant dip in the number of active users on our network ". The company is looking are some predictive analytics solution to help them understand, detect and counter the attacks and make their network connection secure. Think of a connection as a sequence of TCP packets starting and ending at some well defined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP address to a target IP address under some well defined protocol. In total, there are 40 type of attacks to which their network is vulnerable to. But, 3 of them cause the maximum damage. In this challenge, you are given an anonymised sample dataset of server connections. You have to predict the type of attack(s).

## Evaluation Metric
> Submission will be evaluated based on multi-classification accuracy metric.
